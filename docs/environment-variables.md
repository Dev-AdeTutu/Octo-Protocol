# Environment Variables

This document is the authoritative reference for every environment variable read by the server. It is derived directly from the parsing code in `bin/server/src/main.rs` and `crates/store/src/config.rs`. If you add or change a variable in code, update this table — CI enforces that every variable read by the server is documented here (see [Keeping this document in sync](#keeping-this-document-in-sync)).

## Reference table

| Variable | Purpose | Default | Required | Secret |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NETWORK` | Selects the Stellar network the server targets (`testnet` or `mainnet`). Controls which network passphrase and default endpoints are used, and enables the mainnet startup guard. | `testnet` | always | no |
| `HORIZON_URL` | Base URL of the Horizon API used to read ledger and account data. | `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` (testnet) / `https://horizon.stellar.org` (mainnet) | always | no |
| `FRIENDBOT_URL` | Base URL of the Friendbot service used to fund accounts in non-production environments. | `https://friendbot.stellar.org` | optional | no |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string (host, port, database, user, password). | none | always | yes |
| `RUN_MIGRATIONS` | Whether the server runs database migrations on startup. See [postgres-roles.md](postgres-roles.md) for the roles required to run migrations. | `false` | optional | no |
| `DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | Maximum number of connections in the database pool. See [ha-topology.md](ha-topology.md) for sizing guidance. | `10` | optional | no |
| `DB_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_SECS` | Seconds to wait for a pooled database connection before failing. See [ha-topology.md](ha-topology.md). | `30` | optional | no |
| `DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` | Seconds after which an idle pooled connection is closed. See [ha-topology.md](ha-topology.md). | `600` | optional | no |
| `DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_SECS` | Per-statement timeout in seconds applied to database queries. See [ha-topology.md](ha-topology.md). | `30` | optional | no |
| `RATE_LIMIT_BACKEND` | Selects the rate-limiting backend (`memory` or `postgres`). See [ha-topology.md](ha-topology.md) for multi-instance deployments. | `memory` | optional | no |
| `MASTER_KEY` | Primary key material used to encrypt sensitive data at rest. Must be high-entropy; rejected on mainnet if it looks like a placeholder. | none | always | yes |
| `MASTER_KEY_NEXT` | Next master key, set during key rotation so data can be re-encrypted before switching `MASTER_KEY`. | none | optional | yes |
| `AUDIT_CHAIN_KEY` | Key used to compute the tamper-evident audit log hash chain. | none | always | yes |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret used to sign and verify JWTs. Must be at least 32 bytes on mainnet. | none | always | yes |
| `JWT_SECRET_PREVIOUS` | Previous JWT signing secret, accepted during rotation so existing tokens remain valid. | none | optional | yes |
| `JWT_ISSUER` | `iss` claim value written into and validated on JWTs. | `stellar-...` (server default) | optional | no |
| `JWT_AUDIENCE` | `aud` claim value written into and validated on JWTs. | `stellar-...` (server default) | optional | no |
| `ARGON2_MEMORY_KIB` | Argon2id memory cost in KiB used for password hashing. | `19456` | optional | no |
| `ARGON2_ITERATIONS` | Argon2id iteration (time) cost used for password hashing. | `2` | optional | no |
| `ARGON2_PARALLELISM` | Argon2id parallelism (lanes) used for password hashing. | `1` | optional | no |
| `BIND_ADDR` | Address and port the HTTP server listens on. | `0.0.0.0:8080` | optional | no |
| `RUST_LOG` | `tracing`/`env_logger` filter directive controlling log verbosity. | `info` | optional | no |
| `PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public base URL of the web application, used to build links in emails and redirects. | none | optional | no |
| `PUBLIC_API_URL` | Public base URL of the API, used when constructing absolute URLs. | none | optional | no |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | API key for the Resend email provider. | none | optional | yes |
| `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | From address used for outgoing email. | none | optional | no |
| `INGEST_INTERVAL_SECS` | Seconds between ingestion polling cycles. | `5` | optional | no |
| `INGEST_PAGE_LIMIT` | Maximum number of records fetched per ingestion page. | `200` | optional | no |
| `INGEST_LOCK_RETRY_SECS` | Seconds to wait before retrying acquisition of the ingestion advisory lock. See [ha-topology.md](ha-topology.md). | `10` | optional | no |
| `SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_SECS` | Seconds to allow in-flight requests to drain during graceful shutdown. | `30` | optional | no |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated list of origins permitted by CORS. | none (CORS disabled) | optional | no |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` | Comma-separated list of CIDR ranges of trusted reverse proxies, used to resolve client IPs from forwarding headers. | none | optional | no |

### Required column values

- **always** — the server refuses to start without a valid value.
- **mainnet** — required only when `NETWORK=mainnet`; the mainnet startup guard enforces it.
- **optional** — has a default or is only needed for the corresponding feature (e.g. email, CORS).

### Secret column values

Variables marked **yes** carry credentials or key material. Never commit them, log them, or expose them in error messages. Supply them via your secret manager or environment injection.

## Mainnet startup guard

When `NETWORK=mainnet`, the server runs additional validation at startup and refuses to boot if any check fails:

- **HTTPS URLs** — `HORIZON_URL` (and other configured public URLs) must use `https://`.
- **JWT secret length** — `JWT_SECRET` must be at least 32 bytes.
- **High-entropy master key** — `MASTER_KEY` must be high-entropy and must not be a known placeholder or example value.
- **No placeholders** — any secret still set to a documented example/placeholder value causes startup to abort.

These checks exist to prevent accidentally running production with development defaults. Fix the offending variable rather than disabling the guard.

## Keeping this document in sync

Every environment variable read by the server must appear in the table above. A CI check compares the variables read in `bin/server/src/main.rs` and `crates/store/src/config.rs` against the variable names documented here and fails the build when a variable is read in code but undocumented (or documented but no longer read). When adding a variable, add its row in the same change.
