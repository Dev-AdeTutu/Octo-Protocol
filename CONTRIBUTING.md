# Contributing to octo

Thanks for your interest! This project is built incrementally and values correctness and
security over speed (it handles crypto keys).

## Development setup

- **Rust 1.84.1** — pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`; `rustup` will install it automatically.
- **Docker** — for the local Postgres (`docker compose up -d db`).
- **just** — task runner (`cargo install just`), optional but recommended.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
just build && just test
```

## Before opening a PR

Run the same checks CI runs:

```bash
just fmt        # cargo fmt
just lint       # cargo clippy -- -D warnings
just test       # cargo test
cargo deny check   # licenses + advisories (cargo install cargo-deny)
```

All of `fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings`, and the test suite must pass.

## Pre-commit hooks

The repo ships a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that catches formatting drift and secret leaks
before you push. Install the hooks once per clone:

```bash
pip install pre-commit   # or: brew install pre-commit / cargo install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

The hooks run on every commit and cover:

- **rustfmt** — `cargo fmt` (formatting is applied automatically).
- **gitleaks** — scans staged changes for accidentally committed secrets.
- **whitespace checks** — trailing whitespace, end-of-file newline, and mixed line endings.

To run all hooks against the whole tree (e.g. before opening a PR):

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Integration & Load Testing

### Bruno API Collection Tests
The HTTP API routes and challenge-signing scripts can be executed end-to-end non-interactively:

```bash
just test-integration
```

Or manually:
```bash
cd api-tests/scripts && npm install
npx @usebruno/cli run api-tests --env Local
```

**Environment Variables (`api-tests/environments/Local.bru`):**
- `base_url`: The target API server URL (defaults to `http://localhost:8080`).
- Ensure `octo-server` has valid environment variables configured in `.env` (`DATABASE_URL`, `MASTER_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`, `BIND_ADDR`).

### Concurrency Load Tests
High-concurrency stress tests (such as budget reservation under 100-way concurrency) are marked `#[ignore]` so they do not slow down default test runs. To run explicitly:

```bash
cargo test -p octo-store --test store_tests sponsorship_budget_reservation_under_100_way_concurrency_never_exceeds_budget -- --ignored --nocapture
```

> **Troubleshooting `E0514: found crate X compiled by an incompatible version of rustc`.**
> This appears when `target/` holds artifacts from two different `rustc` builds that share a
> version string but not their internal metadata format — e.g. a system `/usr/bin/rustc` vs. a
> rustup-managed toolchain, or after running `cargo clippy` (whose `clippy-driver` writes rmeta a
> plain `rustc` build then rejects). **Fix: `cargo clean && cargo test --workspace`** — a single
> clean rebuild makes all artifacts come from one toolchain. To avoid it: use one `cargo`
> consistently, and don't run `cargo clippy` locally on source-tarball toolchains (clippy is
> enforced in CI on an official toolchain). `cargo build`/`test`/`fmt` are otherwise unaffected.

## Developer tooling: seed data & offline Horizon

Frontend and API work needs realistic data without touching a real network. Two tools cover this.

### Seeding demo data (`just seed`)

```bash
docker compose up -d db
just seed
```

`just seed` runs the `seed` binary against `DATABASE_URL`. It creates a verified demo user, its
wallets, and a small sample deposit history so the API and frontend have something to render.

- **Idempotent.** Re-running `just seed` is safe: existing demo records are reused/updated rather
  than duplicated, so you can run it after every migration without resetting the database.
- **Mainnet refusal.** The seed refuses to run when the configured network is mainnet (it checks
  the network/Horizon configuration and exits with an error). It is intended for local and testnet
  configs only — never point it at production.
- **Credentials.** The demo user's email/password and wallet keys are printed on completion and
  are for local development only. Never reuse them anywhere real.

### Offline mock Horizon

Live testnet calls are slow and flaky, and contributors without network access can't exercise
ingest flows. A small axum-based mock Horizon server serves scripted responses for accounts,
payments, and transaction submit.

Run it standalone:

```bash
cargo run -p mock-horizon   # serves on the port printed at startup
```

or via the compose profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile mock up -d mock-horizon
```

Point the API at it by setting the Horizon URL in `.env` to the mock's address (e.g.
`HORIZON_URL=http://localhost:<port>`).

**Fixtures.** Responses are driven by fixture files under the mock crate's `fixtures/` directory
(accounts, payments, submit results). Edit or add fixtures to script new scenarios; the mock
reloads them per request, so no rebuild is needed for fixture-only changes.

**From tests.** The mock exposes a helper to start it on an ephemeral port and get back its base
URL, so integration tests can run ingest flows hermetically:

```rust
let horizon = mock_horizon::spawn().await; // returns a base URL
// configure the client under test with `horizon.url()`
```

Use this instead of hitting testnet in tests so the suite stays fast and deterministic.

## Conventions
=======

- **Commits:** [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`,
  `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`).
- **Secrets:** never log seeds, private keys, or decrypted material. Secret-bearing types live in
  `wallet-core` and must `zeroize` on drop.
- **Tests:** crypto and derivation code must include test vectors (e.g. SEP-0005).
- **Migrations:** `crates/store/migrations/` is forward-only and append-only. Every PR adding a migration must also update the decision index in `docs/migrations.md` in the same PR.

## Architecture Decision Records

Foundational design decisions live in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Each ADR captures the context, the decision, and its consequences.

- Read the existing ADRs before proposing changes to core design areas (addresses, key handling, polling, etc.).
- New foundational decisions must be recorded as an ADR in the same PR that introduces them, using the template at [`docs/adr/template.md`](docs/adr/template.md).
- ADRs are immutable once accepted; supersede an old ADR with a new one rather than rewriting history.

## Branching

Work on a feature branch; open a PR against `main`. CI must be green before merge.
